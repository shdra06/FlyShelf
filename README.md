## 🎯 What is FlyShelf?

FlyShelf unifies your clipboard across **every device you own** — seamlessly, privately, and at network speed. Copy a paragraph on your office PC, paste it on your phone in the elevator, then paste a file on your home PC. No accounts, no cloud storage limits, no friction.

It's not just a clipboard manager — it's a **complete synchronization ecosystem** that connects your Windows PCs and Android devices into one unified workspace.

**Three sync paths, automatic fallback:**
1. **LAN** — Same WiFi? Files transfer at **full network speed** (~100 Mbps)
2. **Cloudflare Tunnel** — Different networks? Secure tunnel through Cloudflare's edge
